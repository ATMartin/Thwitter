###An awethome Backbone tutorial

This is a super-simple page to get you up and running with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org). 
You can follow along in one of two ways: 

1. Install the app from here and read along with the code (**lame**).
2. Create a new blank app on your computer and follow along with my "js/app.js" for help (*awesome!*)

To install:
From your terminal, type the following commands:
- `git clone https://github.com/ATMartin/Thwitter.git`
- `cd thwitter`
- `bower install`
- `open index.html`
